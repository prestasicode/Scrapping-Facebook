The father was taking a “forced perspective” picture. The little girl was pretending to hold up something in the background. But it was not the domes, or the MBS towers. 

In fact, as Raja Vijayalaya Vajravel and a few others guessed, it is this sleeping baby at The Meadow at Gardens by the Bay.

The sculpture, by British artist Marc Quinn, seems to be floating in mid-air, but actually weighs 6 tonnes! Now that’s a big baby. :) - LHL

P.S. Do share these pics with the family, if you happen to know them.

Didn’t realise what it was about until later. Can you guess? Hint – it was at Gardens by the Bay. – LHL

The situation is improving, but many districts still don’t have electricity and water supply.

Malaysia is one of our closest friends. I called PM Najib to offer to lend them Water Purification Units, with crews, to produce clean water for the flood areas. I am glad the units are now deployed and operating in Kelantan, one of the worst affected states. 

Each unit can produce thousands of litres of clean water a day. Hope this helps the residents get their lives back to normal soon. - LHL

Witnessed Mr J Y Pillay (in red tie) being sworn in as Chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) for another term. Mr Pillay was first appointed to the CPA in 2001, and has been Chairman since 2005. The CPA advises the President on key issues, before the President decides. As CPA Chairman, Mr Pillay also acts for the President in his absence.

I wish him all the best for his new term. - LHL

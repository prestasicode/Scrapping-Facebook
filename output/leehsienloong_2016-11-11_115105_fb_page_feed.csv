The Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP Singapore) has played a valuable role in the Malay/Muslim community since their formation in 1991. Aside from their education, youth and social assistance programmes, AMP has also invested in innovative projects such as Common Space – an incubator to groom start ups from the community.

I was happy to attend AMP’s 25th anniversary dinner last night. I hope AMP carries on working closely with MENDAKI Singapore and other Malay/Muslim organisations, so that the community can continue to shine in our multi-racial Singapore. – LHL

Sejak pembentukannya pada 1991, AMP telah memainkan peranan penting dalam membantu masyarakat Melayu/Islam bergerak maju bersama kaum-kaum lain di Singapura. Selain daripada program pendidikan dan bantuan sosial, AMP juga melabur dalam projek inovatif seperti project ""Common Space” – inkubator untuk melahirkan lebih banyak firma teknolgi atau start-up dari masyarakat Melayu/Islam.

Here is some advice to all...
To the Liberals... take a breath. The world is still spinning. 8 years ago, you asked everyone to accept the election results, support the newly elected President and give him a chance to succeed. Time to follow your own advice. and PLEASE STOP LISTENING TO THE MEDIA HYPE! Judge with your own eyes and ears on what he says and does now.
To the conservatives... Don't blow this by being the asses people think you are. Don't try and undo everything.. instead, make them better. Remember how the last 8 years felt when your ideas were not listened to, when policies were jammed down your throat and DON'T REPEAT THAT MISTAKE!!! Listen to ideas, work with your counterparts across the aisle. Make no mistake, this election result was because the people are tired of business as usual.. If you repeat this mistake, it will be a sure fire way to lose in the next election.
To the Celebrities who vowed ton leave if Trump won.. Please pack your bags and go! By making such  a pledge you have shown that youM love making false threats to push your agenda more than working to make your country better. Buh-Bye!",Mabasa Nhekairo (1470085343020338),4

However, I am not like Trump in so many ways but do not feel demeaned by him. 

He is our duly elected President- Elect after winning against so many odds.

While I do not agree with him in some areas (as I do not with Obama) I trust the American people and our system of checks and balances.

I'm no genius. Don't get me wrong I respect Singapore's founding family for maintaining control for so long and still managing to have the facade of democracy. It is thier relentless grip of control that has allowed such a small country with so few resources and facing great difficulties to become a significant place that is peaceful with a good quality of life.

The last time I took a taxi was 3 years ago. Been using Uber/Grab ever since.

I am sick of having to pay extra charges for using credit card when I take taxi. The worst part is some taxi don't even accept credit cards or simply say that the machine is spoilt. Uber/Grab solved that problem for me.
I am sick of having to walk across streets from my house just to flag a taxi. With Uber/Grab, they solved my problem by waiting for me at the lifts area and best part is there isn't a booking fee. If Uber doesn't charge a booking fee, why should I call and book a taxi.

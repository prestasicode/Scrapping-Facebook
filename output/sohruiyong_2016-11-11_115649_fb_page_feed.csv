Former Singapore football captain Aide Iskandar and I sat down over a cup of coffee for a quick chat on Singapore sports and what can be done to improve our current state. 

His ideas for football are reflective of the incredible leadership he showed as a captain who guided Singapore to two ASEAN football crowns. I particularly identified with the vision that we have to do better career planning and retain our talents in the sport long after they have retired - to continue to train and inspire the next generation of budding athletes, passing knowledge on. 

Lots to be done, but with the right people, it is possible.

What a night of athletics. SEA Games aside, I don't think I've ever seen this big a crowd show up for a 10000m race on the track in Singapore. 

Big thanks to everyone for making this one to remember. Shout out to Singapore Athletics for finally holding the distance races at night! Now we've all seen how epic night races can be. Together as a community we can #MakeSingaporeAthleticsGreatAgain. 

This is a photo of me probably telling a stupid joke at the start line.

Big shoutout to the guy on the far right, Chris Robertson. We both raced NIRCA Cross Country Nationals in 2013 - me for Oregon, him for Iowa State (pretty sure he smoked me there). 

I was fortunate to have his company from the early days in this pack all the way to mile 16 when he made a big move that only I went with and all the way to the end when we were both battling down the home straight. Competition can bring fast times, and in yesterday's case, having a great runner like Chris pushing me past my comfort zone all the way is what brought a sub-2:25 time for both of us. We both clocked in at 2:24:55, personal bests for both of us. 

Thanks brother!
